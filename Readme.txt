Dijkstra Algorithm :
 Can be applied both Direct and un directed Graph 
 No negitive edges should not be present in Graph (Bellmon ford algo for negitive edges)
 
 Kruskal Algorithm :- 
 applied on connected and un-directed graph 
 
 DataStructures :- 
 
 vector   -> Random access available .stored in continuoguios memory 
 list -> implmented using doubly linked list 
 forward_list -> single linked list 
 set -> sorted order along with keys , BST approch : log n for each op like insertion/deletion
 unordered_set -> using hash table .O(1) avg case . O(n) worst case based on hash function 
 map -> same as set 
 unordered_map -> same as set 
 pair -> it allows duplicate keys which is not allowed by maps 
 
 heap :- full binary tree with root always greater/less than it's child nodes
